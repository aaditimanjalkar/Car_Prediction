*Car Price Prediction*

Overview
The Car Price Prediction project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as model, year, mileage, and more. This project leverages a dataset of used car listings to train a model that can accurately estimate the market value of a car.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses raw car data for training the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes data to uncover patterns and insights.
Model Training: Implements various machine learning models to predict car prices.
Model Evaluation: Compares models based on performance metrics like RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Web Interface: A Flask-based web app where users can input car details and get price predictions.
